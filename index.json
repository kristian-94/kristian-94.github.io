If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.\nFirst it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty \u0026lsquo;man in the middle\u0026quot; attack. Finally it gives your site that touch of class\u0026hellip;. which of course a classy person like yourself relies on. Once you implement SSL certificates on your server you\u0026rsquo;ll want to require secure connections using Apache\u0026rsquo;s rewrite module. Now I won\u0026rsquo;t dwell on the creation and signing of certificates, its already well documented. If your just starting out though,heres a few links I recommend;\nCreating self-signed certificates (free, but should only be used internally or for testing, users will; see an \u0026lsquo;Untrusted\u0026quot; warning) Requesting a CA Signed certificate (not free, but the final certificate is trusted and seamless for users) The second link uses the schools internal CA, you will need to pay a public CA like Entrust or Verisign. All of this information is aimed at \u0026rsquo;nix or solaris servers running apache. Why? cause a production windows server is laughable :-p\nNow that you have a certificate, whats next? So there you are you have a shiny new Certificate and Server key, how do you force visitors to your apache driven site to use the SSL? You copied the certificates into the appropite locations right? And you have made the needed changes in httpd.conf right? So now when you view https://example.com you see a \u0026rsquo;trusted\u0026rsquo; warning or your site right? If No to any of these than this article does a pretty good job of outlining those steps.\nThe SSL Works, How do I force connections to use it? First you need to decide if you want to force every page on your site to use SSL, or only a particular sub-domain, or maybe just your admin directory. Since the overhead is minimal there is no harm is forcing the entire domain to leverage SSL, but if it is a self-signed certificate for your personal use than you\u0026rsquo;ll most certainly want to restrict its use to your own areas. This prevents users from seeing that nasty warning \u0026ldquo;This server is not trusted\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;ll know if your using SSL because the url prefix changes from http to https (s for secure).\nForcing entire domain to use SSL You want any visit, any where to use ssl. This probably the simplest solution. Create or append to your htaccess file in the top directory of your server. Some people use a port check (80 is typically http, while 443 is https) but if you have alernate configs or the user just adds :8080 to the end of the url this method is useless. Instead check whether the https environmental variable is set, if not then redirect.\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}$1 \\[R,L\\] Forcing sub-domains to use SSL Maybe you only want mysecretarea.example.com to use SSL, that\u0026rsquo;s easy enough. Its the same premise as above, but you move the htaccess file into the directory that corresponds to the subdomain. Also change the second line like below;\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://mysecretarea.%{SERVER_NAME}$1 \\[R,L\\] Forcing a directory to use SSL This method cn get a little hairier if your using aliases or redirects on top of this one. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to consider what order the commands are read. The basic principle is like so. You want all visits to example.com/admin to use ssl. Create a htaccess file in the parent directory. Again will check for the https variable, but this time we also check for the sub-directory to be in the path.\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^/admin/(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}/admin/$1 \\[R,L\\] ","date":"January 1, 2009","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://kristian-94.github.io/blog/force-ssl/","summary":"Intro Doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter whether it\u0026rsquo;s a CakePHP app for a client, your own personal CMS, or any other web based application.

Turn it on before I get home, or from anywhere, using my phone. It\u0026rsquo;s not \u0026lsquo;smart\u0026rsquo;, doesn\u0026rsquo;t have those features built in.\nApproach The idea is to capture the IR (infra-red) signal from the air con\u0026rsquo;s remote, and be able to output that again on demand. We don\u0026rsquo;t need to decode the signal or understand how fujitsu encodes things.\nWe need an IR receiver, to capture the raw data. Once we have that, we don\u0026rsquo;t need the receiver anymore. Then we just need the IR emitter to output the captured codes.\nHardware Implementation An Arduino is a microcontroller board. It\u0026rsquo;s really good at input and output of electronic signals. The first thing was to capture the signal using the arduino and IR receiver. The serial monitor outputs over USB to the computer everything that is happening on the arduino.\nThe whole build process worked fine, pretty simple. Arduino IDE works well to compile and upload code. The IR receiver worked well to capture the output of the remote. Everything ran at a frequency of 38 KHz as is pretty normal for air conditioners.\nHere it is in action:\nYour browser does not support the video tag. The way this works is the IR led turns on and off very quickly. The \u0026rsquo;long\u0026rsquo; pulses are seen as 1, and short pulses as 0, and in that way it encodes information. It also has a certain tolerance around the pulse time, since it\u0026rsquo;s so short it naturally varies, about 350-450us for short pulses, 1250 for long ones. The 3200,1650 is a spacer pulse, to signal the start/end of a signal.\nIssue 1: Running out of memory The captured commands are so long, that the Arduino did not let me upload that compiled script. We were running out of SRAM, ie. Static Random Access Memory that is really fast but limited. Claude got around this by storing the constants in program memory instead, which was really nice to breeze past that issue.\nconst uint16_t rawData_OFF[] PROGMEM = {...}; Issue 2: HIGH/setting command did not work Problem: OFF command transmitted successfully, but ON command failed Claude told me it was a power/timing issue with longer signals based on research about 750+ element AC protocol problems. It told me about timing drift and some in depth technical stuff but that turned out to be a red herring. But Claude doesn\u0026rsquo;t know everything\u0026hellip;\nBut it did let me see timing drift with some python scripts, comparing the remote to my signal.\nCool looking chart.. but not the source of the issue, the drift is pretty minimal as we can see.\nI found on the docs of the IR remote library we\u0026rsquo;re using to capture that the buffer length was likely too low: https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote?tab=readme-ov-file#compile-options--macros-for-this-library as it says:\n100 is sufficient for regular protocols of up to 48 bits, but for most air conditioner protocols a value of up to 750 is required\nThe ON signal was being truncated at exactly 200 elements due to a small buffer size.\n#define RAW_BUFFER_LENGTH 400 Air cons send the full state of the air con every time, like the temp, fan speed, mode, timers. So this is a pretty long signal, and took 260 pulses, which when truncated won\u0026rsquo;t do anything.\nIssue 3: ON command is different to \u0026lsquo;set to HIGH\u0026rsquo; Even with the full captured command, it still wouldn\u0026rsquo;t turn on, but it would set to HIGH if the unit was already on. It turns out that there is a different command to turn on AND set to high, rather than just set to high. Once I did a recapture, that worked. I compared the two captures and could see a few bits changed from 0 -\u0026gt; 1 so that made me try the new signal.\nNow the IR emitter is working great, and controls the air con. But we\u0026rsquo;re controlling it by having it plugged into the computer and manually telling it to emit each signal. How can we control it remotely?\nRemote control An ESP32 is a small wifi enabled microcontroller. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of like an arduino in that way, but it also has wifi connectivity which is perfect for this. It works similar to the arduino as well in that we just compile and upload code to it through the arduino IDE.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s some C++ code that runs on the ESP32 to create a simple web server. This allows us to receive HTTP GET requests.\n#include \u0026lt;WebServer.h\u0026gt; uint16_t acOff[116] = {3200,1650,350,450,...}; uint16_t acOnHigh[259] = {3200,1650,350,450,...}; void setup() { server.on(\u0026#34;/on\u0026#34;, handleOn); server.on(\u0026#34;/off\u0026#34;, handleOff); } The WebServer library is doing all that for us. Now we just have to do GET requests to the IP address of the esp32 to control it.\nFinal mounting (for now) Could print an enclosure/put it further away.. it works for now.\nSimple web page hosted on a pi, that is the only entrypoint on the home network. Using Cloudflare tunnel we don\u0026rsquo;t have to open ports on the router itself. This server now simply calls 192.168.1.115/on and 192.168.1.115/off.\nLearnings How air con, IR, pi, arduino and esp32 work It was really cool seeing the real captured IR data coming through on the serial monitor. Normally using a remote you just wouldn\u0026rsquo;t think about what is happening on a lower level like that, and it was cool to see the invisible signal being made visible. I understand more what a pi is good for, more of a server/full computer, vs arduino/esp32 which is for controlling components directly. Working together in this system is a cool way to allow each to play to its strengths.\n%%{init: {\u0026#39;theme\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;base\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;themeVariables\u0026#39;: {\u0026#39;background\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;#ffffff\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;primaryColor\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;#ffffff\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;primaryTextColor\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;#000000\u0026#39;}}}%% graph LR USER[\u0026#34;📱 User\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;iPhone Browser\u0026#34;] PI[\u0026#34;🥧 Raspberry Pi\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;Flask Server\u0026#34;] ESP[\u0026#34;💡 ESP32\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;192.168.1.115\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;HTTP + IR\u0026#34;] AC[\u0026#34;❄️ Air Conditioner\u0026#34;] USER ==\u0026gt;|\u0026#34;HTTPS\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;ac.ringertech.org\u0026#34;| PI PI ==\u0026gt;|\u0026#34;HTTP GET\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;/on or /off\u0026#34;| ESP ESP ==\u0026gt;|\u0026#34;38kHz IR Signal\u0026#34;| AC classDef deviceStyle fill:#f8f9fa,stroke:#6c757d,stroke-width:2px,color:#000,rx:10,ry:10 class USER,PI,ESP,AC deviceStyle Claude It is really helpful to have claude as a fallback, rubber duck debugger and helper.

Change weights of inputs in a way that will take us there.\nTwo files: nn.py neural net library importing and using micrograd engine. engine.py 100 lines of python code, no imports.\nnn.py neuron : one link in the chain of weights, ends up getting a value and connected to other neurons. The weight between is the strength of that connection. layer layer of neurons. They are all connected to the input but not eachother, a set of neurons evaluated independently. MLP multi layer perceptron: sequence of layers of neurons.\nWe are computing the derivative of the loss function with respect to the weights of the neural network.\nHow do weights affect the loss function? Use gradient information. Weights are leaf nodes, they are an input. The other leaf nodes are the data but that is fixed.\nGradient calculation In calculus, we can use the product rule to explicitly generate an equation to get the exact derivative. However, we can\u0026rsquo;t do that for these huge functions with 10k parameters and we don\u0026rsquo;t need to.\nWhat is a gradient? A gradient is the slope of a graph at a point. We get this as a limit when increasing x by a small amount. Practically, this means we just need to insert a slightly larger number and rerun our function. Then we see how much it changed, positive or negative, that\u0026rsquo;s the gradient.\nWe normalise by dividing by the height, rise/run. (L2 - L1)/h We can get the gradient of the final L loss with respect to any of the input elements, by only changing it, and then seeing how much L changed. This is the way to verify the calculated overall gradient that is found by traversing each node individually and applying the chain rule from the surrounding nodes.\nIf we know how much d affects L, and how much e affects d, we can then use the chain rule of derivatives to calculate the overall derivative of e on L.\nA + in the chart just pulls through the next node\u0026rsquo;s gradient. A plus has a gradient of 1.0 with respect to the next node, so it can just copy the next gradient to the children nodes. It\u0026rsquo;s basically equivalent of a simple equation eg. y = x + c -\u0026gt; gradient is 1.\nBack propagation This is a recursive application of the chain rule back through the computational graph.\nLeaf Nodes Some inputs are static data. The others are weights. Some others can be bias.\nFor each neuron:\nTake all the inputs and sum all the weights and values. (can have any number of inputs) Add the bias. Take it through an activation function (tanh/sigmoid). This squashes the input into a value between 0 - 1 which is the final output and value of this neuron. We want the local derivative of the neuron\u0026rsquo;s inputs on the final output. This whole thing is one little neuron in the neural net. In the end we\u0026rsquo;ll back propagate through the entire set of neurons for the overall loss function. We really want the neurons output derived from the weights which is the thing we can change.\n","date":"January 1, 0001","hero":"/micrograd_hero.svg","permalink":"https://kristian-94.github.io/projects/micrograd/","summary":"These are my notes taken during implementing the micrograd library and training a neural net to recognise images.\nCheck back soon for a link to a working demo and code :)\nWhat is micrograd?
