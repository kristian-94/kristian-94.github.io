A Youtube channel, online course and community centered around Moodle development and training.

## The problem
When I started trying to learn Moodle, the code and ecosystem around it was very hard to understand. The documentation is also not clear unless you already know Moodle!

I am passionate about teaching and sharing knowledge. This project is my small contribution to make a mark on the Moodle world and help new developers get up to scratch.
- Having a large community of developers contributing is good for the whole Moodle ecosystem. 
- Making this first step for new developers to get up and running is the most important for community growth. 
- We want more developers creating more awesome Moodle plugins and modules.

## The project
A Youtube channel, a Udemy course and a Skillshare course were created to help people. Videos have been recorded over a number of years and continue to be added to the collection. There is a focus on clear communication and building a strong foundation for new Moodle developers.
