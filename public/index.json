If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.\nFirst it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty \u0026lsquo;man in the middle\u0026quot; attack. Finally it gives your site that touch of class\u0026hellip;. which of course a classy person like yourself relies on. Once you implement SSL certificates on your server you\u0026rsquo;ll want to require secure connections using Apache\u0026rsquo;s rewrite module. Now I won\u0026rsquo;t dwell on the creation and signing of certificates, its already well documented. If your just starting out though,heres a few links I recommend;\nCreating self-signed certificates (free, but should only be used internally or for testing, users will; see an \u0026lsquo;Untrusted\u0026quot; warning) Requesting a CA Signed certificate (not free, but the final certificate is trusted and seamless for users) The second link uses the schools internal CA, you will need to pay a public CA like Entrust or Verisign. All of this information is aimed at \u0026rsquo;nix or solaris servers running apache. Why? cause a production windows server is laughable :-p\nNow that you have a certificate, whats next? So there you are you have a shiny new Certificate and Server key, how do you force visitors to your apache driven site to use the SSL? You copied the certificates into the appropite locations right? And you have made the needed changes in httpd.conf right? So now when you view https://example.com you see a \u0026rsquo;trusted\u0026rsquo; warning or your site right? If No to any of these than this article does a pretty good job of outlining those steps.\nThe SSL Works, How do I force connections to use it? First you need to decide if you want to force every page on your site to use SSL, or only a particular sub-domain, or maybe just your admin directory. Since the overhead is minimal there is no harm is forcing the entire domain to leverage SSL, but if it is a self-signed certificate for your personal use than you\u0026rsquo;ll most certainly want to restrict its use to your own areas. This prevents users from seeing that nasty warning \u0026ldquo;This server is not trusted\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;ll know if your using SSL because the url prefix changes from http to https (s for secure).\nForcing entire domain to use SSL You want any visit, any where to use ssl. This probably the simplest solution. Create or append to your htaccess file in the top directory of your server. Some people use a port check (80 is typically http, while 443 is https) but if you have alernate configs or the user just adds :8080 to the end of the url this method is useless. Instead check whether the https environmental variable is set, if not then redirect.\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}$1 \\[R,L\\] Forcing sub-domains to use SSL Maybe you only want mysecretarea.example.com to use SSL, that\u0026rsquo;s easy enough. Its the same premise as above, but you move the htaccess file into the directory that corresponds to the subdomain. Also change the second line like below;\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://mysecretarea.%{SERVER_NAME}$1 \\[R,L\\] Forcing a directory to use SSL This method cn get a little hairier if your using aliases or redirects on top of this one. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to consider what order the commands are read. The basic principle is like so. You want all visits to example.com/admin to use ssl. Create a htaccess file in the parent directory. Again will check for the https variable, but this time we also check for the sub-directory to be in the path.\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^/admin/(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}/admin/$1 \\[R,L\\] ","date":"January 1, 2009","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://kristian-94.github.io/blog/force-ssl/","summary":"Intro Doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter whether it\u0026rsquo;s a CakePHP app for a client, your own personal CMS, or any other web based application.

This is all based off Andrej Karpathy\u0026rsquo;s Github repo and Youtube videos. I am a huge fan of him!\nMicrograd is all you need to train neural networks. Everything else (pytorch/tensor flow) is just efficiency.\nMy notes We need to get the gradient of the loss function and step towards minimal value. Change weights of inputs in a way that will take us there.\nTwo files: nn.py neural net library importing and using micrograd engine. engine.py 100 lines of python code, no imports.\nnn.py neuron : one link in the chain of weights, ends up getting a value and connected to other neurons. The weight between is the strength of that connection. layer layer of neurons. They are all connected to the input but not eachother, a set of neurons evaluated independently. MLP multi layer perceptron: sequence of layers of neurons.\nWe are computing the derivative of the loss function with respect to the weights of the neural network.\nHow do weights affect the loss function? Use gradient information. Weights are leaf nodes, they are an input. The other leaf nodes are the data but that is fixed.\nGradient calculation In calculus, we can use the product rule to explicitly generate an equation to get the exact derivative. However, we can\u0026rsquo;t do that for these huge functions with 10k parameters and we don\u0026rsquo;t need to.\nWhat is a gradient? A gradient is the slope of a graph at a point. We get this as a limit when increasing x by a small amount. Practically, this means we just need to insert a slightly larger number and rerun our function. Then we see how much it changed, positive or negative, that\u0026rsquo;s the gradient.\nWe normalise by dividing by the height, rise/run. (L2 - L1)/h We can get the gradient of the final L loss with respect to any of the input elements, by only changing it, and then seeing how much L changed. This is the way to verify the calculated overall gradient that is found by traversing each node individually and applying the chain rule from the surrounding nodes.\nIf we know how much d affects L, and how much e affects d, we can then use the chain rule of derivatives to calculate the overall derivative of e on L.\nA + in the chart just pulls through the next node\u0026rsquo;s gradient. A plus has a gradient of 1.0 with respect to the next node, so it can just copy the next gradient to the children nodes. It\u0026rsquo;s basically equivalent of a simple equation eg. y = x + c -\u0026gt; gradient is 1.\nBack propagation This is a recursive application of the chain rule back through the computational graph.\nLeaf Nodes Some inputs are static data. The others are weights. Some others can be bias.\nFor each neuron:\nTake all the inputs and sum all the weights and values. (can have any number of inputs) Add the bias. Take it through an activation function (tanh/sigmoid). This squashes the input into a value between 0 - 1 which is the final output and value of this neuron. We want the local derivative of the neuron\u0026rsquo;s inputs on the final output. This whole thing is one little neuron in the neural net. In the end we\u0026rsquo;ll back propagate through the entire set of neurons for the overall loss function. We really want the neurons output derived from the weights which is the thing we can change.\n","date":"January 1, 0001","hero":"/micrograd_hero.svg","permalink":"https://kristian-94.github.io/projects/micrograd/","summary":"These are my notes taken during implementing the micrograd library and training a neural net to recognise images.\nWhat is micrograd?
